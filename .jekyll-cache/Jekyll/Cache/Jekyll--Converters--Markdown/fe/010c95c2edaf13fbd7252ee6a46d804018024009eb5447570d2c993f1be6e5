<p>My name is Alexander Leguizam√≥n-Robayo. 
Currently, I am looking for opportunities to carry out a PhD in Pure mathematics.</p>

<p>Up to April 2021, I was a master student of Mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogot√°.</p>

<p>I have succesfully defended my thesis.
My thesis is related to Jacobi structures and their symmetries under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/sem-interaccionesgeomfisica/organizadores/nicol%C3%A1s-mart%C3%ADnez?authuser=0">Prof.Nicol√°s Mart√≠nez Alba</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/danielesepemaths/">Prof. Daniele Sepe</a> at UFF.</p>

<!--This semester I am teaching differential calculus for engineers and scientists [C√°lculo Diferencial](/teaching/2021icd/)-->

<p>I am also organizing a coding club for undergraduates of all disciplines (in Spanish).
We focus on self-learning, the use of modern tools and techniques, and soft skills,  to build and implement mathematical models related to each of the members‚Äô interests.
Feel free to drop by <a href="https://mathmodcol.github.io/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a master student in Chemical Engineering at NTNU Trondheim under the supervision of <a href="https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge">Prof. Sigurd Skogestad</a>. I focused on process systems engineering, which is a mix of dynamical systems, control theory, optimisation, and computer science applied to practical problems (not necessarily related to the chemical industry).</p>
