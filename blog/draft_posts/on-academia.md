An extended summary of my convoluted academic journey

Looking for job can be a grueling process, yet also a learning experience.
After some interviews (and many months of therapy), I would like to look back at my unorthodox academic journey.
So, be my guest dear reader and accompany me through this trip through memory lane.


When I was younger, I had a hard time coming up with what major to choose.
I had had a nice experience visiting a research group in genetics. 
They were welcoming and always asking questions and bringing up new ideas.
While most of the discussions went above my head, I wanted to be part of such a group.
Naturally, I asked one of the senior researchers and she helped me narrow it down to 3 options: medicine, biology, or chemical engineering.

At the same time, I had other interests.
I was doing well in language, maths and sciences. 
My dad was well aware of that and brought my attention to other engineering fields in particular software, electronics, and biomedical.
Having so many options felt overwhelming, I didn't know what exactly to pick. 

Trying to make a balanced assessment, I choose chemical engineering.
It had mathematics, sciences, and offered the chance to eventually me become part of such a wholesome group of researchers in genetics.

I learned a lot during my bachelor's. 
I was exposed to both theoretical work, wet-lab, and even entrepreneurship, finance and management. 
This period was instrumental in helping me understand what wet-lab work actually entailed. 
I liked to analyse data, coming up with ideas and seeing how theoretical principles applied to experiments.
The detective work of finding what went wrong was very enjoyable.
However, experimental work required additional and highly non-trivial preparation.
Things like specialized pieces of equipment, reactants, and security (this one with very good reason) delayed the brainstorming part that I enjoyed the most.
After at least 6 experimental courses, I decided that experimental work was not for me.

There was another area in which this detective work could be done without having to ask for expensive reactants or requesting a timeslot with a technician: simulation.
Experiments taking up hours to set up and run became a couple of clicks and waiting for less than 5 minutes. 
I also notice how they held promise to design and automate industrial processes which seemed very tedious.
At that time, my main tool were process simulators. 
As I didn't know the inner workings of those pieces of software, finding errors and correcting them was a matter of random trial and error.
This stood in contrast, to experimental work, where I could always go back to the textbook and know what theory to apply.

After 2 years of different jobs (one being in a laboratory), I got funding to travel to Norway and do my master's in process simulation.
This experience was eye opening in many respects. 
The group in Norway knew how to use process simulators, but also *how to build them*.
It was awesome to see how they could code specific solutions from scratch.
There, I got to learn many things about computers, like the basics of parallel computing, automatic differentiation, numerical analysis and even databases.
At the same time, I had the chance to take courses (in the cybernetics and the maths department) that showed me how mathematics were not just a set of instructions for computations, but a formal language. 
In particular, I understood the value of proofs in an engineering context.

While up north, my thesis involved writing a simulation of a plant from scratch and getting data to guide the automation of said plant.
It was my first time writing an open ended software project. 
At some point, I got to face difficulties in getting meaningful results from these simulations.
The final results were not the cleanest, and they left me wondering what I could've done differently.
Also while writing the text I noticed that I was dreading the engineering interpretation of the results.
I cared about the tool and the mathematics that it used.

It all began with a personal challenge. 
I felt super behind compared to all the other researchers in Norway who seemed to know the ins and outs of the maths they were using.
In particular, they were good at recognizing concepts from linear algebra and applying them, while I had to read what matrix multiplication meant many times to still end up trying random orders of matrices until the program worked.
At that time machine learning was becoming popular, so it made sense to learn both linear algebra and machine learning.
I liked learning that so I went more and more into maths.
At some point, I came across the idea of contact geometry and how it is amenable to describe thermodynamics.
In my naivet√©, I thought that could be the reason why there was so much numerical instability in the code of my thesis.

I wasn't aware of what I was getting into. 
The sirens' song was so enticing, that I jumped the ship of engineering to dive into the sea of abstraction.
It took me 2 years to prepare the missing courses in pure mathematics, but I managed to get into the MSc.

This is probably the period of my life where I have seen the most beauty ever.
As one youtuber, said "I am surprised I didn't burn out my beauty receptors".
I learned abstract algebra, geometry, analysis, topology, and many many more things. 
I ended up working in differential geometry studying a generalization of contact geometry.
It could've been applied to thermodynamics, but I never got into that. 

After those 4 years of learning maths, reality struck me. 
I wanted to become an academic. 
I loved the discussions and the passion that all people showed.
Teaching was something I deeply enjoyed and I put a lot of effort in making engaging teaching material. 
So it seemed obvious to do a PhD and become a professor.

At that point in time, I was deeply in debt.
This meant that I would think twice about applying directly to a US institution given that there were lots of exams and fees that I needed to pay just for my application to be considered.
I did not consider any places in South America as I needed a large enough salary to cover my debts and I got several stories of people either moonlighting or using their own savings to make ends meet.
Having had a beautiful experience in Norway, I put most of my energy in finding a position in the Nordics, Benelux, Germany, Austria, or Switzerland.
There were lots of rejections and I didn't know exactly why. 
I blame the fact that I didn't have a BSc in mathematics. 

To look for offers, I was consistently checking professors' websites as well as mailing lists.
I was dedicated to find something in a topic that I found exciting. 
My goal back then was to continue doing fun mathematics.
I even had talks with several tentative supervisors, who sadly didn't have funding at the time.
My mentors and many of the supervisors I contacted strongly recommended me to think it twice to do a PhD.
They told me it could take anywhere from 2 to 6 years post PhD to find a permanent position.
They recommended me to have a plan B, in case life happened and I needed stability.
This made me think deeply about what I really wanted, since by then I had only lived on temporary contracts for at least the last 5 years.


Leaving no stone unturned, I ended up in a website about maths and control.
This website had a section for openings, where I found a position in Aalborg University that related many things with my previous experience.
It was a PhD in computer science.
This seemed like an interesting compromise.
I would be able to keep on doing *some* maths and at the same time get "computer science" written in my CV so I could apply for jobs afterwards.

Back then I thought that a PhD in theoretical computer science meant writing proofs and some code.
This assessment was both true and wrong. 
I had a big culture shock to see how things were done in CS.
For starters, I had no idea about the foundational problems in CS.
To me they sounded like applied logic with a very tenuous connecting thread.
Probably the most shocking part was the difference between communities.
In maths, there were lots of free talks, short courses, and many people wrote and were eager to share free resources.
In computer science, the community felt more closed and results driven.
There weren't as many people sharing free resources. 
I got to know CS communication was done through conferences, and that the publication pace was around 2 papers a year, with strict deadlines and quick review processes.
It then made sense to me that people in CS would not have much time to write free resources.


In retrospect, I was probably judging CS too harshly as I was also going through some personal problems and the whole world was opening up again.
Still, I really appreciated the chance to code again. 
I didn't know how much I missed it and how fulfilling it was to write programs and see them work.
Due to my formal background in maths, I was assigned as a teaching assistant for courses related to programming languages.
This made a huge impact on me, since it allowed me to combine my love for language(s) with programming and mathematics.
Since then I began reading more and more about programming languages and making prototypes in my spare-time.

I was getting more and more second thoughts about continuing in academia after the PhD period.
After my stay in Italy, I came back to Denmark and saw a talk about a topic that sounded eerily similar to one I was learning right after my MSc.
I looked into it and it opened the door to a new world of connections between CS and maths.
A part of me thought of this topic as a possible way to continue indulging my curiosity.
So, in a desperate attempt to keep the passion alive in a withering relationship, I applied for funding to pursue that topic.
Preparing the proposal took me like 2 months and asking many friends for support.
Also, out of inertia, I applied to several academic positions that seemed interesting.

Months passed and one by one I got rejections for all and each of the applications I sent.
I felt... An immense sense of relief.
Deep down, I knew I did not want to continue my life as an academic.

Looking back at this journey, I don't think any of the steps was a waste of time.
I am glad I was able to experience so many different disciplines. 
I wonder how many mathematicians can brag about ~the suffering of~ having been through experimental courses.
I feel lucky that in the buffet of life I was able to taste so many different dishes.
One of the nicest feelings is that of getting a new mode of thinking (kinda like how Megaman gets a new weapon after defeating a boss) from each discipline.
