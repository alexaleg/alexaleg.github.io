Currently, I am a master student of Mathematics at the National University of Colombia in Bogotá. 
My thesis is related to Jacobi structures and their symmetries under the supervision of [Prof.Nicolás Martínez Alba](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/sem-interaccionesgeomfisica/organizadores/nicol%C3%A1s-mart%C3%ADnez?authuser=0) and [Prof. Daniele Sepe](https://sites.google.com/site/danielesepemaths/) from the UFF. 

This semester I will be teaching [differential equations](/teaching/ecdif2020ii) for engineering undergraduates (In Spanish).

I also organize a Coding Club for undergraduates focusing on getting familiar with computational tools, self-learning, and individual responsibility when it comes to learning and applying knowledge. You can learn more [here](https://alexaleg.github.io/mathmod)

Previously, I was a master student in Chemical Engineering at NTNU Trondheim under the supervision of [Prof. Sigurd Skogestad](https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge). I focused on process systems engineering, which is a mix of dynamical systems, control theory, optimisation, and computer science.
