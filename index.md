My name is Alexander Leguizamón-Robayo. 
Currently, I am working as a PhD student at Aalborg University under the supervision of [Prof. Max Tschaikowski](https://maxtschaikowski.com/) and [Prof. Andrea Vandin](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/andrea-vandin).
My work focuses on the study of reduction of dynamical systems coming from biology, cyber-physical systems, or other applications.

Previously, I studied pure mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá.
My focus was on differential geometry and its applications.
I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Nicolás Martínez Alba](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/sem-interaccionesgeomfisica/organizadores/nicol%C3%A1s-mart%C3%ADnez?authuser=0) and [Prof. Daniele Sepe](https://sites.google.com/site/danielesepemaths/). 

Even before, I was a master student in Chemical Engineering focusing on process systems engineering at NTNU, Trondheim under the supervision of [Prof. Sigurd Skogestad](https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge) and [Dr. Adriana Reyes-Lua](https://www.sintef.no/en/all-employees/employee/adriana.r.lua/).
