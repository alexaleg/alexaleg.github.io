Currently, I am a master student of Mathematics at the National University of Colombia in Bogotá. 
My thesis is related to Jacobi structures and their moment maps under the supervision of Prof.Nicolás Martínez Alba and [Prof. Daniele Sepe](https://sites.google.com/site/danielesepemaths/) from the UFF. 


Previously, I was a master student in Chemical Engineering at NTNU Trondheim under the supervision of [Prof. Sigurd Skogestad](https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge). I focused on process systems engineering, which is a mix of dynamical systems, control theory, optimisation, and computer science.
