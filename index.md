# About 
My name is Alexander Leguizamón-Robayo. 
Currently, I am working as a PhD student at Aalborg University under the supervision of [Prof. Max Tschaikowski](https://maxtschaikowski.com/) and [Prof. Andrea Vandin](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/andrea-vandin).
My work focuses on the study of reduction of dynamical systems coming from biology, cyber-physical systems, or other applications.

Previously, I worked in pure mathematics at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá.
My thesis is related to Jacobi structures and their symmetries under the supervision of [Prof. Nicolás Martínez Alba](https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/sem-interaccionesgeomfisica/organizadores/nicol%C3%A1s-mart%C3%ADnez?authuser=0) and [Prof. Daniele Sepe](https://sites.google.com/site/danielesepemaths/). 

Even before, I was a master student in Chemical Engineering at NTNU Trondheim under the supervision of [Prof. Sigurd Skogestad](https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge).
